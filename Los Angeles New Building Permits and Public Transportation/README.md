For this project, I analyzed new building permits approved by the City of Los Angeles from 2013-2022. I compared permit data with the Los Angeles Metro Rail system to investigate the relationship between new buildings and the Metro. 

I obtained my data from Los Angeles Open Data (https://data.lacity.org/). 

Limitations of the data:
1. In calculating the distance between two locations, I used geodesic distance as opposed to travel distance. This means that some distances were slightly underestimated, as they were calculated using the shortest distance, not accounting for limitations of traffic laws or other obstructions such as bodies of water. 

Ideas for future analysis:
1. Use travel time to calculate the distance between two locations to increase accuracy.
2. Using permit data for Los Angeles County, not just the City.
3. Compare popularity of Metro stops for developers by calculating permit counts only to Metro stops in the City of Los Angeles, to ensure an equal comparison between Metro stops/lines.
